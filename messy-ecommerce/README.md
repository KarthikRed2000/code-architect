# Messy E-Commerce Repository

This is an intentionally messy codebase designed for practicing Low-Level Design (LLD) principles.

## 🎯 Purpose
Practice refactoring and applying SOLID principles, design patterns, and clean architecture.

## 📁 Structure
- 13 Python files with deep nesting, code duplication, and tight coupling
- Multiple SOLID violations
- Security issues and code smells

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Analyze the code for violations
2. Identify anti-patterns
3. Refactor using LLD principles
4. Apply appropriate design patterns
5. Implement clean architecture

## 🔍 Main Issues
- Single Responsibility violations
- Open/Closed principle violations
- Deep nesting (arrow anti-pattern)
- Code duplication (DRY violations)
- Tight coupling
- No dependency injection
- Hardcoded values
- Security vulnerabilities

## 💡 Suggested Improvements
- Extract interfaces
- Implement Strategy, Factory, Observer patterns
- Create repository pattern for database
- Add dependency injection
- Separate concerns into layers
- Add proper error handling
- Use configuration management

Happy refactoring! 🎓
